This is the second and final part of the series about code predictability on Elixir. In this part I show how one can use
reducers and macros to create a small framework to enforce code style in your project. When I finished writing this
post, I also ended up creating [ex_pipeline](https://github.com/msramos/ex_pipeline), an open source library that allows
developers to create pipelines while enforcing code style easily.
